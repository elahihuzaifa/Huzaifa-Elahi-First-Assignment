	<center><p>The <b>React.js</b> framework is an open-source <i>JavaScript framework</i> and library developed by Facebook. It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.</p></center>
    <center><p>In <b>React.js</b>, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. <i>These components are individual pieces of a final interface,</i> which, when assembled, form the application’s entire user interface.</p></center>
